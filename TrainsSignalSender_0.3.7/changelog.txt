	- Reduce the frequency of recalculation, to improve the UPS latency. Value configurable in the options

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.2.3
Fixed:
	- bugs of GUI
Improvements:
	- Reimplement quantity of signals, but with a new GUI. 
	- Set difference between signal (item or fluid) quantity and current content of the train. This option is defined on each train stations.
		When set to true, instead of generating, for an item A, X signals from the content of the train, and Y from the signal sender itself, the train station will generate a specific amount of item A to compensate the default one, and produce the final quantity Y-X. (Sorry if it not clear, basically, instead of having X+Y as a result, you will return Y-X).
		The option works even if the option "read content of the train" of the train station is deactivated

Mods:
	- Remote call is not changed, expect for the method "hasSignal". If the signal is present, the method returns the quantity of it
I use it to connect my train station to a decider combinator, with the config "If each item(green icon)>0, produce all items(red icon)", and connect the decider to a filter inserter, that can read the signals.
Thus, I define for my train which quantity of each item I expect. I just connect it to one decider, that I connect to all filter inserted I need, and they will fill it in automatically until each quantity for each item has been reached. (+1 or 2, because the inserter takes more than one at a time).
I definitely struggle to explain it properly, please feel free to ask for more explanation, I'll do my best!

Fixed:
	-Various Bugs fixed

0.1.0
Update:
	- compatible with 0.15.10
Change:
	- Train reading has been removed (As it is provided by the core)
Mods:
	- Remote functions are available-> To set signals (If not place is available and the signal is not already present, this will be ignored), use remote.call("TrainsSignalSender","setsignals",train,signals) where signals is in the same format as the constantcombinator parameters
	- To clear signals, use remote.call("TrainsSignalsSender","clearsignals",train)
